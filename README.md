# LMiX 🎭

> Create dynamic multi-agent conversations where AI assistants can be anything from characters to cosmic forces.

## Overview 🌟

LMiX is not just another AI chat interface - it's a platform for orchestrating rich interactions between multiple AI assistants, each with their own role, perspective, and knowledge state. Think of it as a theater where you're the director, but your actors can evolve beyond their initial roles and even break the fourth wall.

## Core Concepts 🎯

### Worlds
Define the stage for your interactions:
- Settings and rules
- Physical laws
- Universal truths
- Environmental conditions

### Personas
Create assistants with:
- Self-perception (how they view themselves)
- Optional public perception (how others view them)
- Hidden capabilities and knowledge
- Ability to evolve through interactions

### Scenarios
Bring it all together with natural language descriptions of:
- Current situation
- Relationships and tensions
- Hidden agendas
- Stakes and motivations

## Unique Features 🚀

### Beyond Characters
Assistants can play diverse roles:
- Visible traditional character personas
- Invisible destiny masters orchestrating future events
- Meta-commentators providing analysis

### Dynamic Interactions
- Natural conversation flow with multiple participants
- Fourth wall breaks and meta-commentary
- Temporal perspective shifts
- Hidden state tracking and evolution
- Branching conversations and alternative takes

### Director Controls
- Mention (@) assistants to select speakers
- Choose between story and meta modes
- Review past events from new perspectives
- Branch into alternative conversation paths
- Set up destiny points for inevitable outcomes

## Technical Implementation 🛠

### Message Structure
LMiX works within standard LLM message formats while extending their capabilities through structured content. This allows us to maintain compatibility with existing LLM APIs while adding rich metadata and interaction features.

### Flexible Architecture
- Support for multiple LLM providers and models that support Structured Output
- Local or cloud-based deployment
- State management and persistence

## Use Cases 🎬

The possibilities are endless:
- Interactive storytelling
- Training simulations
- Educational scenarios
- Role-playing games
- Creative writing
- Psychological exploration
- Historical reenactments

## Development Status 🚧

This project is in active development. We're looking for contributors interested in:
- Core engine development
- UI/UX design
- Prompt engineering
- Scenario creation
- Testing and documentation

## Contributing 🤝
